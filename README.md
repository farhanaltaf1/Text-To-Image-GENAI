# Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image Project

This is a generative AI project that uses the **Stable Diffusion** model to convert text prompts into images.
( This project was built by following a YouTube tutorial for learning purposes and implemented fully by hand.)

## ðŸš€ Features
- Text-to-image generation
- Based on Stable Diffusion XL
- Google Colab compatible

## ðŸ““ How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Run each cell in sequence
3. Enter your custom prompts and generate images

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- Python 3
- `diffusers`
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- GPU (recommended for faster image generation) if your doesnt equip GPU select runtime and switch to collab GPU in hardware known as T4 GPU
